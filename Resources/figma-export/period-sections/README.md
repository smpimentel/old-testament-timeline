# Period Section SVG Exports

Each SVG is Figma-import ready and includes all nodes that overlap that period range.

## Import
1. Drag one or more SVG files into Figma.
2. Move nodes where you want them.
3. Share back the edited coordinates (or export JSON from Figma plugin), and implementation can be updated.
